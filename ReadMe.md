# TODOs

- DI assembly scanning
- Consider use of fluent validator is not meant for simple types
- Get error mapping logic out of controller action method
- Consider validator is called twice
- Consider if we want to throw from repo as opposed to silently fail if we can't access data correctly
- tidy up XML class for used for deserialization
- better error handling
- automapper to go from XML class to DTO
